## Unsupervised Learning
-------------------------
In unsupervised learning, as you might guess, the training data is unlabeled. The system tries to learn without a teacher. Unsupervised learning allows the system to identify patterns within data sets on its own. In unsupervised learning, an algorithm will group unsorted information according to similarities and differences even though there are no categories provided.
