## INDE 577 - Data Science and Machine Learning 
--------------------------------  

### Course Description
-----------------------
This data science course covers algorithms from supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and if time permits, reinforcement learning. We not only learn the concepts of the machine learning algorithm, but also code from scratch for most of the topics so that we will have a clear understanding of each algorithm instead of applying packages blindly.  

Topics include, but are not limited to:   

Supervised Learning:   
* Model Building and Error Analysis
* Linear Regression
* Gradient Descent
* Logistic Regression
* Neural Nets
* Support Vector Machines
* K-Nearest Neighbors
* Decision/ Regression Trees
* Ensemble Learning   

Unsupervised Learning:
* K-Means Clustering
* Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
