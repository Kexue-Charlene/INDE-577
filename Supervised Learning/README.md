## Supervised Learning
------------------------
 In supervised learning, the training data you feed to the algorithm includes the desired solutions, called labels.   

A typical supervised learning task is **classication**. The spam filter is a good example of this: it is trained with many example emails along with their class (spam or ham),
and it must learn how to classify new emails.  

Another typical task is to predict a target numeric value, such as the price of a car, given a set of features (mileage, age, brand, etc.) called predictors. This sort of task is
called **regression**. To train the system, you need to give it many examples of cars, including both their predictors and their labels (i.e., their prices). Some regression algorithms can be used for classification as well, and vice versa. For example, Logistic Regression is commonly used for classification, as it can output a value that corresponds to the probability of belonging to a given class.    

In supervised learning the datset has features(X) and labels(y), and we usually want to make prediction of the labels (y) base on the features (X).

For supervised learning we cover the following topics:  
* Linear Regression
* Gradient Descent
* Logistic Regression
* Neural Nets
* Support Vector Machines
* K-Nearest Neighbors
* Decision/ Regression Trees
* Ensemble Learning
