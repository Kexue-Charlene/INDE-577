In this file, we will compare different algorithmes by performing the same binary classification task. We will use loan dataset to predict if a person will pay back the loan or not. The methods we will use and compare are: Logistics Regression, KNN, SVM, MLP, Random Forest, and Ensemble.

We also introduce Support Vector Machine (SVM) in this notebook.
