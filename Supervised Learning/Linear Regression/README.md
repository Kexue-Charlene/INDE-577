### Linear Regression
Simple linear regression is a statistical method that allows us to summarize and study relationships between two continuous (quantitative) variables:
- One variable, denoted x, is regarded as the predictor, explanatory, or independent variable.
- The other variable, denoted y, is regarded as the response, outcome, or dependent variable.
Simple linear regression gets its adjective "simple," because it concerns the study of only one predictor variable.  

common notation:

yi denotes the observed response for experimental unit i
xi denotes the predictor value for experimental unit i
\hat{y}_i\\\ is the predicted response (or fitted value) for experimental unit i
Then, the equation for the best fitting line is:
$e^{i \pi} = -1$
