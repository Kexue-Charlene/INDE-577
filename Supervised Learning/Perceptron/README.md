### Perceptron

#### A perceptron has four parts: Inputs, weights and bias, net sum, and activation function.  
1. All inputs $X_{i}$ and a constant 1 for bias are multiplied by their weights <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=W_{i}">  
2. Sum all the multiplied values
3. Plug the weighted sum to the activation function, and it will generate an output. If the output is greater than a certain threshold, then it will classify the point to a certain class, and if not then it will be classified to the other class.
